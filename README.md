# Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-
I have done this Project In Python using,  Regression Model. I have used some basic python libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib and some not so common but very useful libraries like seaborn and sklearn.

we are building a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. we are using Logistic Regression Model for our prediction.
